### **Vision**
To equip students with physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.

### **Objectives**
Enjoy and value the benefits of living an active and healthy life

The Physical Education (PE) department provides a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development, with a focus on fundamental motor skills in lower primary and more complex movements in upper primary. Students experience learning through the concept of movement, athletics, dance, games and sports, gymnastics, outdoor education, physical health and fitness safety, and swimming.

### **Key Approaches and Programmes**
The Goals of the PE curriculum at Yishun Primary are to foster students’:

* <u>Movement Competence</u> - Students are competent and confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities.
* <u>Healthy Lifestyle Practices</u> - Students have a personal commitment to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor time and hygiene.
* <u>Safety Mindset</u> - Students apply risk assessment to manage daily and physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment.
* <u>Core Values</u> - Students make informed and responsible decisions with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound values-based judgements.
* <u>Sense of Enjoyment</u> - Students enjoy and value physical activities and healthy living in a sustainable way.

To complement the PE curriculum, the department organises some key programmes:

**<u>P5 Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) Cohort Camp</u>**

Through a carefully curated programme of outdoor and team-based activities, students developed important life skills such as self-reliance, teamwork, and responsible decision-making. They learned to consider the impact of their actions on themselves and others, while building positive relationships with peers. The camp also provided platforms for students to demonstrate leadership, collaborate effectively, and work towards common goals.

Students were introduced to practical outdoor skills, including basic navigation and a range of teambuilding challenges. Safety awareness was consistently emphasised, ensuring that students learned to manage risks responsibly while stepping out of their comfort zones.

**<u>Healthy Lifestyle Week</u>**
<br>
The aim of Healthy Lifestyle Week is to promote awareness among students on the need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and provide a platform for participation in healthy lifestyle activities.
During the Healthy Lifestyle Week, students are encouraged to participate in a variety of physical activities in school and answer simple quizzes on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. All these activities served to increase the awareness that staying healthy can be fun.  
For the Primary 5 students, in collaboration with Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF), the school also introduces the Blood Pressure (BP) initiative, where every student is loaned out with a Blood pressure monitor to bring home for a week. The aim is for students and their family members to take responsibility and monitor their own health.
The school also collaborates with National Kidney Foundation (NKF) to create awareness on looking after their kidneys through the NKF ‘K-Force’ Bus where students board the exhibition bus to play and learn about the role of the kidneys and how to take care of them.
Staying healthy is a choice. Let’s all work together to maintain a healthy lifestyle!
