Yishun Primary’s English Department envisions that at the end of their primary school years, students will be empathetic and effective communicators of the English Language. To achieve this, we aim to develop students to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers. Beginning from Primary 1, students will experience a student-centred curriculum that inspires students to develop a love for the language, participate in engaging activities at the classroom and school levels, and develop 21st century competencies and skills. At the same time, our school values will be inculcated and students are also encouraged to have a Growth Mindset. We hope that through these efforts, students will be engaged, take ownership of their learning and develop the right values in persevering when learning the language.

#### **Learning Experience &amp; Approaches**

**<u>STELLAR</u>**
<br>
The STELLAR 2.0 Programme acts as the core English curriculum for all primary levels in the school. It is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children’s literature.
<br>
<br>
Amongst the many pedagogical strategies incorporated into the STELLAR curriculum are the Shared Book Approach (SBA), the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) and Reading for Pleasure (through Extensive Reading). Using a rich variety of print and non-print resources, authentic contexts are provided to the students thus aiding the development of media and visual literacy skills.

**<u>Library</u>**
<br>
Reading is essential for students in gaining knowledge and skills. At Yishun Primary School, we aim to cultivate a reading culture where students have access to books and develop a reading habit. Students are brought to the library fortnightly during their class library period. They would have the opportunity to explore the titles in the library and borrow these books for reading before the morning assembly or to read for leisure at home.
<br>
<br>
The English Language Department plans a range of activities for the whole school. Some of these include:
* Book Buzz sessions by NLB
* Book Promotions
* Book Reviews
* Rewards for Top Borrowers  

We hope that all students would love reading and reap its benefits.

**<u>EL Celebration of Learning</u>**
<br>
The English Language Celebration of Learning is an annual event held and organised by the English Language Department to promote the effective use of the language, the love for reading and developing students’ communication skills (e21CC skills). Anchored on a Stellar unit or language skill, students are engaged in activities which develop the love for reading and cultivate a reading habit, develop and enhance their knowledge of language features, receptive skills (reading and viewing) and productive skills (writing and representing).
