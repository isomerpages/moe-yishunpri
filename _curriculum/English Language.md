Our programmes are organised to:

*   Bridge learners’ competencies when using English Language

**Build Programmes**

To instill the joy of learning in our students, the department brings about customised teaching approaches to cater to specific learning needs of all our students. The Build programmes aim to support our students in acquiring and mastering language through lesson packages designed by our teachers. 

These come in the form of SLS Packages for Oracy, Punctuation and Grammar which are assigned periodically to all students to build on their language skills learned in the classroom.

**Bridge Programmes**

To ensure that students are well-supported in their learning of language skills, the bridge programmes provide extensive support to students who require more support in the acquisition of language skills. KidsREAD is one such programme the department is running which reaches out to students who require close reading support. During the sessions, students are guided in reading by the student leaders from our partner school.

The Bloom programmes were designed with pedagogical emphasis on Multiliteracies, Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue to develop our students’ knowledge and meaningful application of the English language.
