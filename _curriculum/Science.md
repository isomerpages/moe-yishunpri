### **Vision**

To nurture inquisitive learners who actively explore, question and make sense of the world around them.

### **Objectives**

* Foster a sense of wonder and respect for the environment among students while promoting sustainable practices through environmental education initiatives.
* Provide students with meaningful learning experiences aligned with Science Syllabus, allowing them to recognise the significance and relevance of science in their daily lives.
* Nurture scientific literacy in students and to provide them with a strong foundation in science to pursue STEM learning in the future

The goal is to prepare students to be effective citizens who can contribute to a technologically driven world by providing them with a sound foundation in science, the spirit of scientific inquiry, and the ability to engage confidently in the Practices of Science.

### **Key Approaches and&nbsp; Programmes**

**<u>Experiential learning</u>**
<br>
To teach Science effectively, it is important to go beyond theory and didactic teaching and provide opportunities for experiential learning and hands-on application. Meaningful learning experiences can be effective in teaching science to students, particularly when they are integrated with a well-designed curriculum that emphasise important concepts and ideas.

Such experiences allow students to make connection with concepts and skills learnt in the classroom with real-life contexts. They are also able to see how individual concepts are interconnected.

1.  **SPARKLE Kits**<br>The school taps on the SPARKLE (Science Pack Activity Resource Kits for Learning) kits which are developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Science Centre Singapore. The kits encourage students to explore and test their science ideas through lots of “hands-on, minds-on” activities accompanied with questions and discussion.

2.  **Science Kits**<br>The department curates lesson units that are paired with science kits to facilitate experiential learning. These resources provide students with the materials and guidance they need to conduct their own experiments and explore scientific concepts on their own. For example, at Primary 2, students are provided with butterfly kits as they learn about the life cycle of a butterfly, in collaboration with the English Department. This interdisciplinary approach allows students to strengthen both their scientific understanding and language skills. At Primary 5, students construct their own terrarium sets to observe the water cycle in action and understand its importance to living things and the environment around them.

3.  **Urban Farming Curriculum**<br>The school also taps on an array of modern farming systems to engage students. At Primary 5, they experience first-hand the pollination and fertilization process as the school grows fruiting plants using the school’s in-house Nutrient Film Technique system. At Primary 6, they learn about energy transfer through the school’s integrated farming system (Aquaponics) where fish waste is utilized to grow vegetables. The system is also powered via solar panels.

4.  **Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) Programme**<br>Unique to Yishun Primary is our Plant Tissue Culture Programme. Plant tissue culture is a collection of techniques used to maintain or grow plant cells, tissues or organs under sterile conditions. We are proud to be one of the few primary schools in Singapore to have PTC facilities in our school. At Primary 3, students learn to cultivate edible mushroom using compost generated from the school’s food waste programme. At Primary 5, they learn about the Science and art of Orchid Hybridisation. In fact, Dendrobium Yishun Primary School was a hybrid that was created by our very own students.

**<u>Science Enrichment Programme</u>**
<br>
This programme aims to develop students’ interest and ability in Science through engaging activities that go beyond the standard curriculum, while fostering scientific thinking skills such as observation, experimentation, analysis, and critical thinking. It also provides opportunities for students to explore Science in greater depth, promoting a deeper understanding of concepts and encouraging creativity and innovation to solve scientific problems.

1.  **Science Olympiad Training**<br>This training is provided for students to explore various scientific subjects, encouraging them to pursue their passion for science and excel in their chosen areas of interest.
    
2.  **E2K Science Programme**<br>This programme aims to instill a love for Science and foster the development of scientific inquiry process skills among participants. It seeks to nurture important e21CC such as critical thinking, and effective communication skills. Students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge, developing scientific thinking and reasoning, confidence, independence, scientific habits, attitudes, and dispositions.

3.  **Science Competitions and Outreach Programmes**<br>Science competitions and outreach programmes are platforms for students to explore their interest in the subject by providing opportunities for them to demonstrate their knowledge and skills. It also provides students with the opportunity to collaborate and work in teams through hands-on learning activities.
