The Science Curriculum Framework at Yishun Primary is based on scientific inquiry, which encourages students to develop an open and inquisitive mind, aligning with 21st century competencies. The goal is to prepare students to be effective citizens who can contribute to a technologically driven world by providing them with a sound foundation in science, the spirit of scientific inquiry, and the ability to engage confidently in the Practices of Science.

**Key Approaches and  Programmes**

**Experiential learning**

To teach Science effectively, it's crucial to to go beyond theory and didactic teaching and provide opportunities for experiential learning and hands-on application. Meaningful learning experiences can be effective in teaching science to students, particularly when they are integrated with a well-designed curriculum that emphasizes important concepts and ideas. 

Such experiences allow students to actively engage with the material, which can increase their motivation to learn and help them to remember what they have learned. They are also able to see how individual concepts are interconnected.

1.  **SPARKLE Kits** At Primary 3 and 4, the school taps on the SPARKLE (Science Pack Activity Resource Kits for Learning) kits which are developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Science Centre Singapore. The kits encourage students to explore and test their science ideas through lots of “hands-on, minds-on” activities accompanied with questions and discussion.
    
2.  **Science Kits** From Primary 3 to 6, the department curates lesson units that are paired with science kits to facilitate experiential learning. These resources provide students with the materials and guidance they need to conduct their own experiments and explore scientific concepts on their own. For example, at Primary 4, students are given mealworms kits as they learn about the life cycle of animals. At Primary 5, students are each given an electrical kit as go through blended learning to learn about circuits.
    
3.  **Modern Farming Systems** The school also taps on an array of modern farming systems to engage students. At Primary 5, they experience first-hand the pollination and fertilization process as the school grows cherry tomatoes using the school’s in-house Nutrient Film Technique system. At Primary 6, they learn about energy transfer through the school’s integrated farming system (Aquaponics) where fish waste is utilized to grow vegetables. The system is also powered via solar panels.
    
4.  **Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) Programme** Unique to Yishun Primary is our Plant Tissue Culture Programme. Plant tissue culture is a collection of techniques used to maintain or grow plant cells, tissues or organs under sterile conditions. We are proud to be one of the few schools in Singapore to have PTC facilities in our school. At Primary 3, students learn to cultivate edible mushroom using compost generated from the school’s food waste programme. At Primary 4, they learn about the Science and art of Orchid Hybridization. In fact,  Dedrobium Yishun Primary School was a hybrid that was created by our very own students.

**Science Enrichment Programme**

This program aims to develop students' interest and ability in Science through engaging activities that go beyond the standard curriculum, while fostering scientific thinking skills such as observation, experimentation, analysis, and critical thinking. It also provides opportunities for students to explore Science in greater depth, promoting a deeper understanding of concepts and encouraging creativity and innovation to solve scientific problems.

1.  **Science Olympiad Training** This training is provided for students to explore various scientific subjects, encouraging them to pursue their passion for science and excel in their chosen areas of interest. 
    
2.  **E2K Science Programme** Adapted from Israel's E2K Programme, this programme aims to instill a love for Science and foster the development of scientific inquiry process skills among participants. It seeks to nurture important 21st century competencies such as resilience, resourcefulness, critical thinking, and effective communication skills. Students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge, developing scientific thinking and reasoning, confidence, independence, scientific habits, attitudes, and dispositions.
    
3.  **Science Competitions and Outreach** Science competitions and outreach programs are platforms for students to explore their interest in the subject by providing opportunities for them to demonstrate their knowledge and skills. It also provides students with the opportunity to collaborate and work in teams in hands-on learning activities.
