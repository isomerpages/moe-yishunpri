**Vision**

To provide an engaging and authentic learning environment that cultivates resilient learners and confident problem solvers.

**Objectives**

* Foster interest in the subject and instil resilience in students
* Integrate learning experiences and real-world applications to make learning Mathematics enjoyable, relevant, and meaningful.
* Develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through problem solving. 

In the learning of Mathematics, students engage in activities to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills, individually and collaboratively. The use of concrete manipulatives help to develop concepts and build competencies such as spatial awareness, locomotor skills and other cognitive development. 

**Key Approaches and Programmes**

**Mathematics Around Us**

We believe that when students can recognise the relevance of Mathematics in the real world, they are better able to appreciate and relate to the value of Mathematics and Mathematical concepts to real-world applications. We use everyday examples to deepen their learning of Mathematics. Solving real-world problems contributes to the studentsâ€™ metacognitive awareness as they discuss solutions, think aloud and reflect on what they are doing.

**Math Carnival**

The Math Carnival offers our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students the opportunity to have fun in the learning of Mathematics. The Mathematics curriculum is brought to life through a myriad of hands-on activities and real-life problem-solving scenarios.

Students develop an appreciation for Mathematics beyond the classroom and textbooks and apply various thinking skills and heuristics to solve non-routine Mathematics problems and get their hands on concrete objects and pictorial representations to illustrate Mathematical concepts.

**Math &amp; Science Trail**

Primary 3 students take part in an interdisciplinary Math and Science trail to take the application of Mathematics word problems and Science concepts outside of the classroom.&nbsp; This ICT-infused trail not only provides an opportunity for our students to relate knowledge gained in class to real-world phenomen. It also develops our students' social skills and promotes team-building.

**E2K (Mathematics)**

The E2K (Mathematics) is an enrichment programme for selected Primary 5 and 6 students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

During the programme, students are given opportunities to collaborate with their peers through activities such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess and to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
