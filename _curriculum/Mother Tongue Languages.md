### **Key Approaches and Programmes**

**<u>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Programme</u>**
<br>

A series of different ethnic activities during each festive period are planned to ignite the joy of learning MTL.

The first highlight of the year is the Chinese New Year celebration. All students are provided with authentic cultural appreciation experiences through exciting hall performances and subsequent class activities on the eve of Chinese New Year as well as during MTL lessons.

<br>**<u>3S Programme (STAR, SHINE, SHARE)</u>**
<br>
The 3S programme is the signature programme of the Chinese Language unit.

In order to build a good reading culture in the school, customised reading packages are designed to emphasise our school’s values. Reading booklets are used to capture the progress of every student and their efforts are affirmed during ‘Celebrate Success’ sessions at the school level. Each session will normally commence with a guided reading session using an e-book followed by class activities bearing the same theme.

In SHINE, our teachers conduct inter-class activities to identify talented students and to mentor them to participate at the national events. 

In SHARE, we encourage our students to write. We share our good stories written by our students by publishing our very own Chinese Essay Book named “绽放” and Chinese Newsletter.

**<u>E-Immersion Programme</u>**
<br>
The Mother Tongue Language department partners with schools in China, Brunei, and India to promotes cross-cultural communication and understanding equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in a globalized world, preparing them to be responsible, engaged, and respectful global citizens.
