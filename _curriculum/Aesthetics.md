### **Vision**

To develop lifelong and confident learners who appreciate the Arts.

### **Objectives**

* Provide a holistic learning experience that nurtures creativity and effective communication through the Arts
    
* Instil an appreciation for artistic works and respect for local and global artists' histories and cultures
    
* Provide students with opportunities to explore and discover their talents and interests
    

The Aesthetics department believes that the Arts play a vital role in shaping students' overall development by promoting self-expression, critical thinking, and cultural understanding. Through various art forms, we strive to inspire students to become well-rounded individuals who can communicate effectively and confidently in a diverse and ever-changing world.

### **Key Approaches and Programmes**

**<u>Music Education</u>**
<br>
The Aesthetics department takes a holistic and student-centred approach to music education. Our curriculum is designed to develop a lifelong appreciation of music and nurture students' musical qualities. From P1 to P6, students participate in authentic musical experiences such as singing, playing instruments, and creative expression. With the integration of ICT tools, our digital music curriculum enhances students' skills and knowledge, providing them with a dynamic and engaging learning experience.

**<u>Art Education</u>**
<br>
The Art curriculum aims to develop active artists and informed audience members through inquiry-based learning (IBL), digital tools, and museum-based learning journeys. The curriculum aims to nurture essential 21st-century competencies, including confidence and communication skills, fostering an appreciation for art's significance in our society.

Our Primary 4 students would participate in the National Gallery Museum-based Learning Journey to view local art while engaging in discussions using the 'See, Think, Wonder' thinking routine to develop their critical thinking skills.
