PAL is a key component of the primary school curriculum in Singapore. The lessons are designed to promote the holistic development of students by engaging them in a range of experiential and active learning activities. In Yishun Primary school, our students undergo hands-on and experiential learning through the domains of Sports and Games, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Drama and Outdoor Education.

The activities are structured to promote critical thinking, creativity, teamwork and leadership. Students also learn social-emotional learning competencies such as social awareness, responsible decision-making and relationship management through the lessons. Teacher-led discussions are also a critical part of PAL lessons as they help students to reflect on their experiences and learn from them. At the end of their PAL journey in lower primary, students will be able to exhibit confidence and curiosity and continue their learning with a positive attitude.
