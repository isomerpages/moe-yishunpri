At LaunchPad@YPS, we believe in cultivating self-directed learning and ownership of learning among our students.

<img src="/images/Experience/Signature%20Programme/launchpad_02_v1.jpg" style="width:440px;height:344px; float: right">By allowing them the freedom to choose the programmes they wish to participate in, we are empowering them to take control of their own learning journey. This helps our students to develop greater self-awareness, as they identify their passions and strengths, and build self-confidence as they take charge of their learning. They also develop self-reflection skills as they evaluate their learning and progress, which in turn leads to continuous self-improvement.

The range of activities offered at LaunchPad@YPS cuts across the cognitive, aesthetic, moral, physical, social and leadership (CAMPSL) student outcomes.
