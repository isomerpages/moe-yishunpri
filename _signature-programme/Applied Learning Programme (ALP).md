### **STEM (Sustainability)**
Our ALP STEM (Sustainability) aims to connect academic knowledge and skills with real-world applications, while promoting sustainable practices and habits through our environmental education.

We emphasise the application of thinking skills and the integration of knowledge across subject disciplines, encouraging students to stretch their imaginations and apply what they learn in authentic contexts. Additionally, we provide students with a space where they can explore hands-on activities and apply their learned concepts and skills in real-world contexts.

The school integrates the learning of sustainability through the curriculum by making explicit connections between environment-related learning with real-life applications. Over the years, the school has built on a strong foundation by linking existing programmes with new offerings.

For example, the school leverages its learning and equipment from its food waste and plant tissue culture facilities to cultivate edible mushrooms. Such regenerative practices help students better appreciate the concept of circular economy, which is key to sustainability.

### **Environmental Sustainability**
Aligned with the Eco Stewardship Programme, the school promotes environmental sustainability through the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture, and Community. By empowering our students as eco-stewards, it strengthens the nexus between theory and practice, enabling them to experience and contribute to sustainability efforts. This approach also helps students better relate to green practices learned in the classroom and fostered engagement by encouraging them to review their actions and bring about the desired changes or outcomes. Overall, our ALP serves as a key platform for cultivating a sense of agency and ownership within our students, encouraging them to make positive environmental impacts.

For example, in the ’Much-room for Investigation’ programme, the school integrates sustainability into its curriculum by connecting environmental learning with real-life applications. This strengthens the nexus between theory and practice, making it easier for students to understand and engage with green practices. The program empowers students as eco-stewards, giving them the opportunity to experience sustainability efforts first-hand and to give back to the community. Sustainability concepts are also infused in the character education program, with the goal of cultivating students' sense of agency and ownership to effect positive change in the environment.

**<u>Curriculum</u>**
<br>
<img src="/images/Experience/Signature%20Programme/alp_03_v1.jpg" style="width:350px;height:233px; float: right">By aligning the programme to the Primary Three science and social studies syllabus, students were engaged with meaningful learning experiences. Their learning was deepened as they were allowed the opportunity to apply concepts learnt to authentic real-life context.

**<u>Campus</u>**
<br>
<img src="/images/Experience/Signature%20Programme/alp_04_v1.jpg" style="width:350px;height:226px; float: right">Tapping on existing infrastructure allowed for effective use of existing resources. Compost generated from food waste was used to grow edible mushroom in the PTC lab. During social studies, the students made use of the Aeroponics farming system to experience first hand how vegetables can be grown effectively and efficiently within a short span of time.

**<u>Culture</u>**
<br>
<img src="/images/Experience/Signature%20Programme/alp_05_v1.jpg" style="width:350px;height:246px; float: right">The programme serves as an opportunity for students to explore how compost generated via the school’s established food waste programme can be converted into something functional. The IBL also helps demonstrate the concept of circular economy, which is key to sustainability.

**<u>Community</u>**
<br>
To extend the IBL to include elements of service learning, students grew spinach during social studies lessons via the Aeroponics system and donated the vegetables to the community fridge located at a neighbouring HDB block. This provide students with an opportunity to give back to the community.
