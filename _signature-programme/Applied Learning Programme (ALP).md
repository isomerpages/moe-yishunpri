### Applied Learning Programme: STEM (Sustainability)

Our ALP at Yishung Primary focuses on STEM (Sustainability) and aims to connect academic knowledge and skills with real-world applications, while promoting sustainable practices and habits through our environmental education. Our approach emphasizes the application of thinking skills and the integration of knowledge across subject disciplines, encouraging students to stretch their imaginations and apply what they learn in authentic contexts. Additionally, we provide students with a space where they can explore hands-on activities and apply their learned concepts and skills in real-world contexts.

The school integrates the learning of sustainability through the curriculum by making explicit connections between environment-related learning with real-life applications. Over the years, the school has built on a strong foundation by linking existing programmes with new offerings. For example, the school leverages its learning and equipment from its food waste and plant tissue culture facilities to cultivate edible mushrooms. Such regenerative practices help students better appreciate the concept of circular economy, which is key to sustainability.

Aligned with the Eco Stewardship Programme, the school promotes environmental sustainability through the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture, and Community. By empowering our students as eco-stewards, it strengthens the nexus between theory and practice, enabling them to experience and contribute to sustainability efforts. This approach also helps students better relate to green practices learned in the classroom and fostered engagement by encouraging them to review their actions and bring about the desired changes or outcomes. Overall, our ALP serves as a key platform for cultivating a sense of agency and ownership within our students, encouraging them to make positive environmental impacts.
