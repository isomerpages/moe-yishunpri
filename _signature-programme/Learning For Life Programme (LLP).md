Yishun Primary School’s LLP revolves around Performing Arts, which aligns with the school’s vision and mission. Our LLP is grounded on the belief that every student possesses the potential and drive for self-improvement to develop and expand their musical talents and abilities.

The LLP is structured in two tiers, providing a gradual acquisition of knowledge and skills in performance arts.

* Tier 1 programmes present students with opportunities to explore various musical experiences, discover their passion, and foster self-directed learning skills. As part of the digital musical curriculum, students particpate in modular programmes to learn six musical instruments such as Angklung and Cornet. Their musical experience is enriched through different programmes held during school assemblies and recesses.
* Tier 2 programmes focuses on developing students’ talents and interests. Along with the acquisition of skills and knowledge, LLP also equips every student with 21st century competencies and reinforces the inculcation of school and universal values through platforms and opportunities such as Artist in Me, eModules, Competitions & Performances and Enrichment Courses.

Our goal is to instil a life-long passion and involvement in the Performing Arts in our students by the end of their six years in primary school.
