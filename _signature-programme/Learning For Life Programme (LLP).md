### **Nurturing Confidence and Values Through the Arts**

The objective of our LLP is to build **confidence** for students to use music to **communicate** their thoughts and emotions and **connect** with others.

Our 2-tiered programme offers students opportunities to immerse themselves in the arts, broadening their experiences and encouraging them to take ownership of their learning. This approach helps students pursue their passions, deepen their skills and knowledge, and apply their learning while connecting with peers and the community.

**<u>Tier 1: Experience diversity through Music</u>**

In this tier, students are exposed to a wide range of art forms, cultures and traditions through assembly shows, modular programmes and learning journeys. These experiences promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world’s diversity. Additionally, in-class performances help students build confidence, express themselves and connect with their peers through music.

**<u>Tier 2: Connecting and enriching community</u>**

This tier caters to students with a strong passion or talent for music, who wish to use it as a tool to engage with and enrich the community. Our Artist in Me programme and partnerships with external organisations promote inclusivity by allowing students to gather with like-minded peers to perform and connect with the broader community through music.
