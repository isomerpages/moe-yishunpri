Our curriculum is specially designed based on <a href="https://www.nel.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">MOE’s Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a>.

It comprises of 2 flagship programmes, the **HI-Light Programme** and **Starlight Literacy Programme for English and MTL**. In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a **Weeks of Wonder project**.

#### **Hi-Light Programme**
**<u>Holistic development through an Integrated approach to learning</u>**
<br>The HI-Light Programme supports the holistic development of children through an integrated approach to learning. It ignites the joy of learning in children. As children learn holistically from their experiences and do not compartmentalise what they learn, the learning experiences in the HI-Light Programme are planned as a whole to help children make sense of the world around them.

#### **Starlight Programme**
The Starlight Literacy Programme aims to nurture early childhood bilingualism. It is offered in English and the three Mother Tongue Languages, providing opportunities for children to enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language, communicate with confidence and be aware of local traditions and customs. 
Language learning is made fun for children through the use of a rich variety of resources such as Big Books, songs and games set in the local context.

#### **Pilot Programme to Increase MTL Exposure in MOE Kindergartens**
To build a strong Mother Tongue Language (MTL) foundation and nurture children’s motivation to learn MTL, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has implemented a pilot programme to increase children’s exposure to MTL in selected MOE Kindergartens (MKs).

**<u>What this means for your child (MK@Yishun, from 2026)</u>**
<br>From 2026, MK@Yishun will be implementing this pilot programme for both K1 and K2. Under the programme, children will have an **additional 30 minutes of learning activities conducted in MTL**.

**<u>What children will learn</u>**
<br>The programme continues to focus on developing children’s:
* Listening and speaking skills
* Early literacy skills

These will be supported through age-appropriate resources and engaging activities.

**<u>Through the programme, your child will:</u>**
* Experience joy in learning and grow in confidence using MTL
* Have more opportunities to learn and use MTL within and beyond school



#### **Weeks of Wonder (WoW) projects!**
To deepen children’s learning, each term culminates in a WoW project. Children work together with their friends and teachers to investigate topics of their interest. Through the WoW projects, children experience the joy of self-motivated learning and find answers to their questions.

These experiences seek to:
* Encourage collaboration as children work together to investigate a topic of their interest;
* Develop process skills as children gather information from different sources and communicate their findings; and
* Promote communication skills as children carry out WoW projects in English and their Mother Tongue Languages.
