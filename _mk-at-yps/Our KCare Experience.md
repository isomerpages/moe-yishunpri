**<u>Modular Activities</u>**
<br>**Modular Activities** provide opportunities for continuity of childrenâ€™s experiences in different areas of interest across a week. By entering **immersive environments** that excite them to **explore and discover through play**, children get to engage in **deeper** and **more complex** forms of play.

**<u>Free Play</u>**
<br>**Free Play** provides opportunities for children to choose what and who they want to play with, and how they want to play. They take place in four areas that provide children with a range of play experiences that can inspire their **creativity and imagination**. Nurturing reading among the children is also important and **Dedicated Reading Time** is provided for children to be engaged in reading daily.
