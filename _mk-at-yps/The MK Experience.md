##### **Our Curriculum**
Our curriculum is specially designed based on <a href="https://www.nel.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">MOE’s Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a>.

It comprises of 2 flagship programmes, the **HI-Light Programme** and **Starlight Literacy Programme for English and MTL**. In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a **Weeks of Wonder project**.

##### **Hi-Light Programme**
**<u>Holistic development through an Integrated approach to learning</u>**
<br>The HI-Light Programme supports the holistic development of children through an integrated approach to learning. It ignites the joy of learning in children. As children learn holistically from their experiences and do not compartmentalise what they learn, the learning experiences in the HI-Light Programme are planned as a whole to help children make sense of the world around them.

##### **Starlight Programme**
The Starlight Literacy Programme aims to nurture early childhood bilingualism. It is offered in English and the three Mother Tongue Languages, providing opportunities for children to enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language, communicate with confidence and be aware of local traditions and customs. 
Language learning is made fun for children through the use of a rich variety of resources such as Big Books, songs and games set in the local context.

##### **Weeks of Wonder (WoW) projects!**
To deepen children’s learning, each term culminates in a WoW project. Children work together with their friends and teachers to investigate topics of their interest. Through the WoW projects, children experience the joy of self-motivated learning and find answers to their questions.

These experiences seek to:
* Encourage collaboration as children work together to investigate a topic of their interest;
* Develop process skills as children gather information from different sources and communicate their findings; and
* Promote communication skills as children carry out WoW projects in English and their Mother Tongue Languages.
