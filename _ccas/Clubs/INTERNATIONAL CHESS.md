# INTERNATIONAL CHESS

### Synopsis:

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chess is a fun, creative and challenging strategic board game for all ages. As a game of strategy, Chess promotes cognitive thinking among the players as they analyze each move in the game. We aim to develop the playersâ€™ patience and tenacity while playing the game and also inculcate in them our school's core values of responsibility, respect, integrity and resilience.</p>
