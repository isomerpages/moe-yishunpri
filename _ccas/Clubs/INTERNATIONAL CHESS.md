##### **Synopsis**
Chess is a fun, creative and challenging strategic board game for all ages. As a game of strategy, Chess promotes cognitive and critical thinking among the players as they analyze each move in the game. We aim to develop the playersâ€™ patience and tenacity while playing the game and also inculcate in them our school's core values of gratitude, care, resilience, respect, responsibility and integrity.
