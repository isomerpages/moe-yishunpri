# ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE

### Synopsis:

Environmental Science aims to develop pupils into environmental champions, where they gain a global awareness of environmental issues, passionately encourage others to adopt environmentally-conscious practices and create solutions to real world environmental problems at a micro-level. Pupils will also get opportunities to go for field trips, take part in competitions and participate in school outreach activities through Green Ambassadors training.
