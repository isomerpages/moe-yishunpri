Environmental Science aims to develop students into environmental champions, where they gain a global awareness of environmental issues, passionately encourage others to adopt environmentally-conscious practices and create solutions to real world environmental problems at a micro-level. Students will also have the opportunities to go for field trips, take part in enrichment programmes and  competitions as well as  participate in school outreach activities through Green Ambassadors training.
