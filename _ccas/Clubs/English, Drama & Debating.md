Join the EL, Drama &amp; Debating Club and develop essential skills in debate, writing, and drama. Through engaging activities and hands-on training, you will gain confidence in public speaking, creative expression and critical thinking.

In drama, you will learn key dramatisation techniques, including vocal projection, body language, facial expressions and spatial awareness. You will also have the opportunity to collaborate with friends to put up performances, bringing stories to life through live performances and video platforms.

In writing, you will learn to create different types of stories, including scripts for performances and arguments for debates. You will practise organising ideas clearly, sharing them confidently and taking part in competitions.

Beyond honing your craft, you will also develop valuable life skills, such as thinking critically and speaking with confidence.
Opportunities in the Club:
* Discover and develop your hidden talents
* Perform in front of an audience
* Work as a team to bring stories to life

Come be a part of a vibrant community where creativity meets confidence!
