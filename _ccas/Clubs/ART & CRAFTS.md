##### Synopsis:
The Art & Crafts CCA serves as a platform for our pupils who have a passion for Visual Arts to showcase their artistic talents. Pupils are able to explore with various mediums to create artistic works which express their ideas, imagination and reflections based on various themes. 

To deepen their appreciation for Visual Arts, pupils are exposed to local and international artists’ artworks through learning journeys. To instill a sense of global awareness and gratitude, our pupils also embark on various meaningful projects which connect to the current society.

Through meaningful art-making processes, pupils develop their character and grow in our school values such as care, gratitude, responsibility and resilience.

##### SYF 2019 – "Sea-ing Plastic"
7 of our Primary 2 pupils participated in the SYF Art 2019 (Category A) and the team’s artwork entitled “Sea-ing Plastic” has been awarded a Certificate of Recognition. The artwork will be displayed at the National Museum of Singapore.

The concept of citizenship is illustrated through the harmonious living of the sea animals. By reusing plastics, we are creating an awareness of the plastic pollution in the seas. We are committed to champion our school wide and nation’s upcycling efforts. We are confident that we can nurture responsible global citizens.

##### Achievements:
Singapore Youth Festival 2017 (Certificate of Recognition)  

##### SYF 2017 – Anything is Possible 
The theme for 2017, “Artist and Space”, invited YPS’ young artists to imagine, inquire as well as discover many ways to interpret and express the concept of ‘space’. In the process, they found inspiration from people, places and even objects within their environments. They created artworks that are personal and meaningful to them. 

One of YPS’ SYF Art teams compromising Pineda Maya Emilia Rodriguez (6 Sincerity), Samantha Ashley Parama Sivan (6 Sincerity) and Whitney Zen (6 Nation Loving) was awarded the Certificate of Recognition for their artwork titled “Anything is Possible”.

Participating in the exhibition had enabled the YPS’ SYF Art teams to develop core 21st Century Competencies as they entered the realm of imagination and discovery to express their ideas and dreams through the artwork. They also acquired enduring values such as resilience and strong adaptability that shaped their characters through the shared experiences. This fruitful experience had inspired them towards greater heights.

##### Our Art Club pupils and their Artworks

Our Art Club pupils experience pure joy and make wonderful discoveries. They are exposed to various forms and mediums in art such as drawing, painting, mixed media, 3D assemblage, collage as well as craft throughout the art-making processes.

Our pupils got creative and had fun making paper bags. They also learnt to create interesting designs such as making the bag handles look like the shoe laces from the shoe graphics on the bag!

##### Upcycling
In line with our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), pupils engage themselves in Upcycling where “unrecyclable” waste is turned into something of value. They learn to create art with items of waste and their final products can be impressive.

##### Learning Journeys

We believe that Art is everywhere. Therefore, our Art club experiences are not confined to the classroom context per se. Our pupils have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to understand and gain greater awareness of the importance of the role of art in our environment and society.

##### <u>ART is Everywhere!</u>
We believe that Art is everywhere. Therefore, our Art club experiences are not confined to the classroom context per se. Our pupils have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to understand and gain greater awareness of the importance of the role of art in our environment and society.

During one of our learning journeys, our pupils made their first attempts at Urban Sketching. They thoroughly enjoyed practising drawing on location at the Singapore Art Museum.

##### Moving Forward and Values Inculcation through Art Club

It is the mission of the Art Club to stimulate and nurture the spirit of exploring and love for Art in the pupils. The Art Club provides a nurturing environment where teachers fan pupils’ passion for Art as they are given the space to express themselves creatively. We also aim to inculcate in our pupils the importance of perseverance, excellence and independence as they strive to complete every piece of artwork. They are constantly encouraged to do their best and be the best!

Our pupils went on a learning journey to the Singapore Art Museum on 31 July 2018 as part of Art Club’s experiential learning. The exhibition titled _Imaginarium: Into the Space of Time_, enables our pupils to understand how the past experiences have conditioned the present times and the future. In addition, through the spirit of discovery and exploration, our pupils were motivated to relate their learning to real life experiences as they took a closer look at the concept of time in relation to people of different cultures.

Our pupils constructed knowledge actively as they expressed themselves freely based on their childhood memories via a hands-on session at the museum. Their drawings were put up after that. Affective, behavioural and cognitive engagement were evident during this session.

One of our pupils was seen cranking the mutoscope to view an immersive installation of the future. Such animation devices make learning meaningful through movement and visual connections and experiences.

It was an enriching experience for both the teachers and the pupils at the museum. The museum environment encourages varied expression of ideas whilst pupils create meaning and make sense of the world from their creative lens. As supported by the Reggio Emilia approach, the environment is indeed a third teacher. It brings pupils level of engagement and joy of learning to a different level. Ultimately, as the approach envisions, we hope that our pupils will grow to be protagonists of their own learning.
