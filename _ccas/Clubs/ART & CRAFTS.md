# ART & CRAFTS

### Synopsis:

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Art & Crafts CCA serves as a platform for our pupils who have a passion for Visual Arts to showcase their artistic talents. Pupils are able to explore with various mediums to create artistic works which express their ideas, imagination and reflections based on various themes.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">To deepen their appreciation for Visual Arts, pupils are exposed to local and international artists’ artworks through learning journeys. To instill a sense of global awareness and gratitude, our pupils also embark on various meaningful projects which connect to the current society.</p>

### SYF 2019 – "Sea-ing Plastic"

7 of our Primary 2 pupils participated in the SYF Art 2019 (Category A) and the team’s artwork entitled “Sea-ing Plastic” has been awarded a Certificate of Recognition. The artwork will be displayed at the National Museum of Singapore.   
The concept of citizenship is illustrated through the harmonious living of the sea animals. By reusing plastics, we are creating an awareness of the plastic pollution in the seas. We are committed to champion our school wide and nation’s upcycling efforts. We are confident that we can nurture responsible global citizens.

### Achievements:

Singapore Youth Festival 2017 (Certificate of Recognition)  

### SYF 2017 – Anything is Possible 

  

The theme for 2017, “Artist and Space”, invited YPS’ young artists to imagine, inquire as well as discover many ways to interpret and express the concept of ‘space’. In the process, they found inspiration from people, places and even objects within their environments. They created artworks that are personal and meaningful to them. 

One of YPS’ SYF Art teams compromising Pineda Maya Emilia Rodriguez (6 Sincerity), Samantha Ashley Parama Sivan (6 Sincerity) and Whitney Zen (6 Nation Loving) was awarded the Certificate of Recognition for their artwork titled “Anything is Possible”.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Participating in the exhibition had enabled the YPS’ SYF Art teams to develop core 21st Century Competencies as they entered the realm of imagination and discovery to express their ideas and dreams through the artwork. They also acquired enduring values such as resilience and strong adaptability that shaped their characters through the shared experiences. This fruitful experience had inspired them towards greater heights.</p>

### <u>Our Art Club pupils and their Artworks</u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Art Club pupils experience pure joy and make wonderful discoveries. They are exposed to various forms and mediums in art such as drawing, painting, mixed media, 3D assemblage, collage as well as craft throughout the art-making processes.</p>

Our pupils got creative and had fun making paper bags. They also learnt to create interesting designs such as making the bag handles look like the shoe laces from the shoe graphics on the bag!

### <u>Upcycling</u>

In line with our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), pupils engage themselves in Upcycling where “unrecyclable” waste is turned into something of value. They learn to create art with items of waste and their final products can be impressive.


### <u>Learning Journeys</u>


We believe that Art is everywhere. Therefore, our Art club experiences are not confined to the classroom context per se. Our pupils have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to understand and gain greater awareness of the importance of the role of art in our environment and society.
