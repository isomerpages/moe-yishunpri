**Empowering Future Creators at Yishun Primary ICT Club**

At the Yishun Primary School’s ICT Club, we don’t just use technology, we create it. Our mission is to nurture future-ready learners by turning curiosity into innovation. Through hands-on exploration, our members dive into the world of coding and programming, bringing their ideas to life on screen.

With the addition of 3D printing and design, students now have the power to transform digital concepts into physical reality. Along this journey, members develop essential computational thinking and critical problem-solving skills, preparing them to lead in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
