# CONCERT BAND

### Synopsis:

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yishun Primary Concert Band provides opportunities for our students to develop an appreciation of music. We also aim to enrich their lives through music. The band provides a supportive environment for our members to participate in a variety of local and international musical activities and competitions. Over the years, the band has been invited to perform at events such as the MOE Work Plan Seminar and National Day Observance Ceremony organised by MOE. To develop build global awareness and cross-cultural skills in our band members, there are also opportunities for them to participate in immersion programmes at countries such as Hong Kong and Thailand.  </p>

### 2019 Activities:

<p style="text-align: justify;">7 YPS band pupils were selected to take part in the annual WBAS Youth Band Festival. This festival gathered young musicians for four days of rehearsal, workshops and team building activities to spur each other on the pursuit of excellence. It was a celebration of Musical Excellence and Friendship.</p>
