At Yishun Primary School, our Football Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) aims to equip our members with essential football skills while fostering a deep sense of sportsmanship. Through structured training sessions and active participation in competitions, our players develop technical proficiency, tactical awareness, and resilience.

Beyond the game, our Football CCA instills the core values of excellence, respect, and friendship. Players learn the importance of discipline, commitment, and perseverance as they strive for excellence in both training and matches. They are encouraged to show respect—not only towards their teammates and coaches but also towards their opponents and officials. Through shared experiences on and off the field, strong friendships are forged, creating a supportive and inclusive team environment.
