##### **Synopsis**
Floorball is a fun and fast-paced sport played indoors with floorball sticks and a ball. We seek to build character, develop teamwork, promote responsibility and foster a sense of camaraderie among our members. We hope to achieve this through training and competitions which will further provide opportunities to develop our budding talents.
