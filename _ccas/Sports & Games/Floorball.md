Floorball is a fun and fast-paced sport played indoors with floorball sticks and a ball. We seek to build character in our students, develop teamwork, promote responsibility and foster a sense of camaraderie among our members during our weekly training sessions. Through our termly social-emotional learning (SEL) lessons, we work with our students to support them as they grow into leaders of character.
