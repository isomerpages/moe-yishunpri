Basketball CCA at Yishun Primary School aims to develop our students holistically through the sport of basketball. Through structured training sessions, students build strong fundamental skills while learning the importance of sportsmanship, teamwork, respect, and resilience.

Our players are given meaningful opportunities to apply their learning through friendly matches and competitions. This year, both our Senior Boys and Junior Boys teams will represent the school in the National School Games, where they are challenged to perform, persevere, and grow in confidence on a competitive platform.

To further broaden their learning experiences, our students also participate in friendly matches with neighbouring schools and attend professional league games. These exposures help them deepen their understanding of the sport, appreciate high-level play, and be inspired to strive for excellence both on and off the court.
