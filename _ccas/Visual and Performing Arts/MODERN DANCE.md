##### Synopsis:
In Yishun Primary Modern Dance CCA, our students who come from diverse backgrounds always work together to present a beautiful and synchronised performance through good teamwork and self-discipline. In 2018, we achieved Certificate of Accomplishment in the SYF Arts Presentation. We were honoured to be invited by the Odyssey Dance Theatre Ltd to perform in the 8th DanzINC Festival at the Victoria Theatre. In 2019, we had the privilege to perform at the Istana Open House on Labour Day. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our members are engaged through online sessions in the form of e-CCA. We will continue to provide opportunities for our pupils to develop their passion and talent in dance.
