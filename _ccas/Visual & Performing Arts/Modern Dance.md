##### **Synopsis**
Yishun Primary Modern Dance CCA aims to bring students who come from diverse backgrounds to work together to present a beautiful and synchronised performance. Through the practice sessions, students will learn contemporary dance and movement techniques, develop good teamwork and self-discipline. 
Our dancers have performed at various external events such as Istana Open House on Labour Day (2019) and Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (2022). 
We hope that talented and interested young dancers can join us in our dance journey.
