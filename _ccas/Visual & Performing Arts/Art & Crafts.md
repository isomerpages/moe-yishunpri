The Art &amp; Crafts CCA serves as a platform for our students who have a passion for Visual Arts to showcase their artistic talents. Students are able to explore with various mediums to create artistic works which express their ideas, imagination and reflections based on various themes.

To deepen their appreciation for Visual Arts, students are exposed to local and international artistsâ€™ artworks through learning journeys. To instill a sense of global awareness and gratitude, our students also embark on various meaningful projects which connect to the current society.

Through meaningful art-making processes, students develop their character and grow in our school values such as care, gratitude, responsibility and resilience.
