The Art &amp; Crafts CCA serves as a platform for our students who have a passion for Visual Arts to showcase their artistic talents. Students are able to explore with various mediums to create artistic works which express their ideas, imagination and reflections based on various themes.

To deepen their appreciation for Visual Arts, students are exposed to local and international artists’ artworks through learning journeys. To instill a sense of global awareness and gratitude, our students also embark on various meaningful projects which connect to the current society.

Through meaningful art-making processes, students develop their character and grow in our school values such as care, gratitude, responsibility and resilience.

##### **Our Art Club students and their Artworks**
Our Art Club students experience pure joy and make wonderful discoveries. They are exposed to various forms and mediums in art such as drawing, painting, mixed media, 3D assemblage, collage as well as craft throughout the art-making processes.

Our students got creative and had fun making paper bags. They also learnt to create interesting designs such as making the bag handles look like the shoe laces from the shoe graphics on the bag!

##### **Upcycling**
In line with our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), students engage themselves in Upcycling where “unrecyclable” waste is turned into something of value. They learn to create art with items of waste and their final products can be impressive.

##### **Learning Journeys**

We believe that Art is everywhere. Therefore, our Art club experiences are not confined to the classroom context per se. Our students have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to understand and gain greater awareness of the importance of the role of art in our environment and society.

##### **ART is Everywhere!**
We believe that Art is everywhere. Therefore, our Art club experiences are not confined to the classroom context per se. Our students have the opportunities to go on learning journeys to understand and gain greater awareness of the importance of the role of art in our environment and society.

During one of our learning journeys, our students made their first attempts at Urban Sketching. They thoroughly enjoyed practising drawing on location at the Singapore Art Museum.

In April this year, our students also went to Orchid Park Secondary School and learnt about Digital Art and Print-making under the Direct School Admission (DSA) Out Reach Programme.

##### **Moving Forward and Values Inculcation through Art Club**

It is the mission of the Art Club to stimulate and nurture the spirit of exploring and love for Art in the students. The Art Club provides a nurturing environment where teachers fan students’ passion for Art as they are given the space to express themselves creatively. We also aim to inculcate in our students the importance of perseverance, excellence and independence as they strive to complete every piece of artwork. They are constantly encouraged to do their best and be the best!

Our students went on a learning journey to the Singapore Art Museum on 31 July 2018 as part of Art Club’s experiential learning. The exhibition titled&nbsp;_Imaginarium: Into the Space of Time_, enables our students to understand how the past experiences have conditioned the present times and the future. In addition, through the spirit of discovery and exploration, our students were motivated to relate their learning to real life experiences as they took a closer look at the concept of time in relation to people of different cultures.

Our students constructed knowledge actively as they expressed themselves freely based on their childhood memories via a hands-on session at the museum. Their drawings were put up after that. Affective, behavioural and cognitive engagement were evident during this session.

One of our students was seen cranking the mutoscope to view an immersive installation of the future. Such animation devices make learning meaningful through movement and visual connections and experiences.

It was an enriching experience for both the teachers and the students at the museum. The museum environment encourages varied expression of ideas whilst students create meaning and make sense of the world from their creative lens. As supported by the Reggio Emilia approach, the environment is indeed a third teacher. It brings students level of engagement and joy of learning to a different level. Ultimately, as the approach envisions, we hope that our students will grow to be protagonists of their own learning.
