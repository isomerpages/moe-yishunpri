Yishun Primary Concert Band provides opportunities for students to develop an appreciation of music and enrich their lives through it. The band fosters a supportive environment for members to participate in various local and international musical activities and competitions. Over the years, it has been invited to perform at events such as the MOE Work Plan Seminar and the National Day Observance Ceremony organized by MOE. To build global awareness and cross-cultural skills, members also have opportunities to join immersion programs in countries like Hong Kong and Thailand.

The band actively participates in prestigious music events, such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, where members showcased their talent in the Flexible Band and Percussion Ensemble categories. Notably, the Flexible Band performed When the Dendrobium Blooms by Satoshi Yagisawa, a piece specially commissioned for Yishun Primary School, while the Percussion Ensemble performed Caprice by Shin-ichi Kaneda, both delivering captivating performances. Additionally, seven YPS band students took part in the WBAS Youth Band Festival, a four-day event featuring rehearsals, workshops, and team-building activities, fostering musical excellence and friendship.
