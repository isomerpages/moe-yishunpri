The Yishun Primary School Concert Band provides students with a platform to develop their musical talents and cultivate a deeper appreciation for music. Through our band, students not only enhance their musical skills but also build confidence, discipline, and teamwork.

We offer a supportive and enriching environment where members can participate in various local and international musical activities and competitions. Over the years, our band has been invited to perform at prestigious events such as the Sree Narayana Mission Charity Drive and has collaborated with secondary schools in combined concerts, including La Famille de Musique 1 and 2.

Join us and embark on a rewarding musical journey!
