Yishun Primary School Concert Band (YPS Band) is a vibrant and disciplined performing group that nurtures students through music, character development and teamwork. Guided by our motto “One Band, One Sound”, our members learn that every individual matters and that excellence is achieved when we work together with respect, responsibility and resilience.

Through regular sectionals, full band practices and performances, students are trained to develop strong musical foundations, listening skills and ensemble awareness. Beyond technical skills, the Band also places strong emphasis on leadership, perseverance and confidence, helping students grow not just as musicians but as well-rounded individuals.
