Yishun Primary Scouts CCA offers a vibrant platform for self-development and self-discovery, where Scouts grow in a closely-knit and engaging environment. Through exciting games and meaningful activities, our Scouts build character, develop leadership skills, and form lasting bonds.

Our Scouts take part in community service projects, camps, and competitions, providing opportunities to connect with peers from other schools and broaden their experiences. To support their growth, we follow a structured progress and proficiency badge system across three levels — Bronze, Silver, and Gold Arrow — preparing Scouts to strive for the prestigious Chief Scout’s Award (Cub) formerly known as Akela Award.

We take pride in our Scouts’ achievements, having earned the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award for an impressive 18 consecutive years, along with the Honours Pennant in 2009.

Through these rich experiences, we aim to nurture motivated, independent, and adaptable individuals who build gracious relationships and contribute positively to society.

Join us on this exciting journey of adventure, learning, and growth!
