# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

### Vision

A healthy mind and a healthy body through a healthy lifestyle 

### Mission 

To equip students with knowledge on social, mental and physical skills and values to embrace a healthy lifestyle.

### **Physical Education Objectives** 

<p style="text-align: justify;">To enable our students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The physical education programme provides a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development. The purpose is to help all students develop a foundation for an active life. The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>

### **<u>Goals of Physical Education</u>**  

**Goal 1:** Acquire a range of motor skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.

**Goal 2:** Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.

**Goal 3:** Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.

**Goal 4:** Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.

**Goal 5:** Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.

**Goal 6:** Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

### **The 7 learning areas that students experience in physical education:**

* Athletics (from Primary 3)
* Dance
* Games and Sports
* Gymnastics
* Outdoor Education
* Physical Health and Fitness
* Swimming (by the end of P6)

### **Highlights of some programmes:**

### Sports Fiesta  

One of the events that our P3 to P6 students look forward to is the Annual Sports Day held at Yishun Sports Stadium. However, it has not been held since 2020. To ensure students continued to experience sporting activities, Sports Fiestas were organised for the students with the necessary safe management measures in place. Students challenged themselves to complete the various activities and do their best. Students had a lot of fun while demonstrating sporting excellence.

### P5 Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) Cohort Camp

<p style="text-align: justify;">The OLE serves as a platform for our students to develop character, social-emotional competencies and leadership skills as they interact with one another and forge new bonds and friendships with their peers through their common shared experiences and goals. students were engaged in many interesting activities such as concrete art, longkang fishing and sensory trail.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For many of our students, this may well be their first time stepping out of their comfort zones of their home and familiar environment to one where they were constantly challenged. Cheers to their courage in facing the challenges and completing their 3-Days of outdoor learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The P5 OLE would be a memorable experience for all the students for they have strengthened their friendships, cared for and motivated each other throughout the 3 days.</p>

### P3 Day Camp  

The P3 students are exposed to Outdoor Education which engages their sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations. Students develop appropriate outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. The students’ learning experiences are set in authentic contexts which include a day trip around the neighbourhood, locate the position of self in relation to the landmarks in the school and its neighbourhood using pictorial charts and apply key principles and considerations of packing for a day trip. 

### Healthy Lifestyle Week and Fiesta

The aim of Healthy Lifestyle Week and Fiesta is to promote awareness among students and parents on the need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and provide a platform for pupil-parent bonding through participation in healthy lifestyle activities.

During the Healthy Lifestyle Week, students are encouraged to participate in a variety of physical activities both in school as well as at home. students also had to answer simple quizzes on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. All these activities served to increase the awareness that staying healthy can be fun.  

Parents play a critical role in promoting a healthy lifestyle among the students. They participated in certain activities as a family and encouraged their child for other activities that required their endorsement. 

For the P5 students, in collaboration with National Health Foundation (NHF), the school also introduced the Blood Pressure (BP) initiative, where every pupil was loaned out with a Blood pressure monitor to bring home for a week. The aim was for students and their family members to take responsibility and monitor their own health.

Staying healthy is a choice. Let’s all work together to maintain a healthy lifestyle!
