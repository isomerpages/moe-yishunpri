# PHYSICAL EDUCATION

### Vision

A healthy mind and a healthy body through a healthy lifestyle 

### Mission 

To equip students with knowledge on social, mental and physical skills and values to embrace a healthy lifestyle.

### **Physical Education Objectives** 

<p style="text-align: justify;">To enable our students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The physical education programme provides a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development. The purpose is to help all students develop a foundation for an active life. The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>

### **<u>Goals of Physical Education</u>**
