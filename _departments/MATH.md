### Mission

Providing an authentic and engaging learning environment to develop reflective and critical Mathematical thinkers.

### Key Mathematics Programmes

## **Math Carnival**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Primary 1 and Primary 2 students have an exciting and authentic learning experience through the Math Carnival. They are engaged in the learning of Mathematics through a myriad of hands-on activities and real-life problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Complementing the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, the activities have enabled students to develop an appreciation for Mathematics beyond the classroom and textbooks and have joy for the learning of Mathematics. They apply various thinking skills and heuristics to solve non-routine Mathematics problems. They also use concrete objects and pictorial representations to illustrate Mathematical concepts.</p>
