### Vision

<p style="text-align: justify;">At YPS, we want to develop in every student a <b>sense of wonder</b> and <b>respect for the world</b> around us.</p>

### Mission

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed in providing opportunities for our students to explore and develop their natural sense of <b>curiosity</b> in a responsible and conducive environment. As such, the Science Department aims to provide our students with <b>experiences</b> which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through our engaging and content-rich programmes, we want our students to <b>appreciate</b> how Science influences each of us and our environment.</p>

### Applied Learning Programme: Environmental Science

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through our ALP at YPS, developed in the area of <b>Environmental Science</b>, we want to connect academic knowledge and skills with our students’ real world. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching imagination and applying these into our authentic society and world we live in.</p>
