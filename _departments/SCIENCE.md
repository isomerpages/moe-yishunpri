# SCIENCE

### Vision

<p style="text-align: justify;">At YPS, we want to develop in every student a <b>sense of wonder</b> and <b>respect for the world</b> around us.</p>

### Mission

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed in providing opportunities for our students to explore and develop their natural sense of <b>curiosity</b> in a responsible and conducive environment. As such, the Science Department aims to provide our students with <b>experiences</b> which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through our engaging and content-rich programmes, we want our students to <b>appreciate</b> how Science influences each of us and our environment.</p>

### Applied Learning Programme: Environmental Science

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through our ALP at YPS, developed in the area of <b>Environmental Science</b>, we want to connect academic knowledge and skills with our students’ real world. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching imagination and applying these into our authentic society and world we live in.</p>

## OUR SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES

### **Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are proud to be one of the few schools in Singapore to have PTC facilities in the compound. Over the years, we also cultured a few hybrids successfully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PTC is widely used to produce clones of a plant in a method known as micropropagation. It is a collection of techniques used to maintain or grow plant cells, tissues or organs under sterile conditions on a nutrient culture medium of known composition. The PTC programme at YPS is an extension of our Science curriculum on flowering plants. It is designed to train our students on orchid hybridization and the basic skills of aseptic culture using orchid seeds. They gain an insight on how humans can also contribute to creating diversity in living things.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As an extension to the PTC programme, our students also produce hand-crafted glass coasters using orchid flowers as they study the structures of the orchids. On top of that, these glass coasters were used as a source of funding to help the less fortunate.</p>
