<p style="text-align: justify;">Through its LLP, Yishun Primary School is in a unique position as it leverages its Performing Arts to further achieve the school’s vision and mission. The LLP is customised based on the philosophy that every student is talented, has the potential and drive for self-improvement with an attitude of excellence towards the Aesthetics.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This belief is guided by two thrusts: Music for All and Music for Excellence. Putting the beliefs into action, the school planned the LLP according to two domains: Experience and Empower.</p>
