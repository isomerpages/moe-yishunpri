Growth Mindset
--------------

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Yishun Primary School, we believe that having a growth mindset is crucial for success in life. Growth Mindset refers to the belief that a person’s abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. <br>The school has embarked in imbuing a Growth Mindset (GM) culture in the school through the GM curriculum which includes explicit instructions and integration of the key growth mindset messages across subjects.   </p>
Key Growth Mindset Messages:

CHAT (Connecting Heart And Thoughts)
------------------------------------

CHAT sessions provide teachers with a platform to meet individual students regularly to get to know them better. These sessions not only helps strengthen teacher-student relationship (TSR) but also helps build mutual respect and trust. Teachers use the CHAT sessions to motivate the students and also reach out to them to provide the necessary support.
