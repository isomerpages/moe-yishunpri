### Vision

To nurture Future Ready and Responsible Digital Learners.

##### **Mission**

*   <p style="text-align: justify;">The ICT Department in Yishun Primary School aims to prepare our pupils for the future, equipping them with the 21st Century Competencies and guide them to be discerning and responsible digital learners, who are rooted in values. </p>

##### **Beliefs**

1.      Pupils’ learning are empowered by technology.

2.      Pupils are responsible and savvy technology users. 


### ICT in Total Curriculum 

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that ICT is a tool to amplify the learning of our pupils – deepening subject knowledge and acquiring 21st Century Competencies. In Yishun Primary School, we integrate technology into the school’s Total Curriculum based on sound pedagogy approaches. Aligning with MOE Baseline ICT Standard, pupils will be exposed to different technologies tools and computer skills (e.g. Productivity Tools, Collaborative Tools, Communication Tools, curating skills and Basic computer operation), which aims to help them to deepen or extend their understanding for the subject. We want to ensure that every pupil’s learning experience is empowered, enhanced and enriched by technology. </p>

  

### **Cyber Wellness - Navigating the Cyber World**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping pupils to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, they should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe responsible use. Pupils should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this technology-driven world, the cyber world has become part of our daily lives. Hence, it is important to educate our pupils in the navigation of the cyber world. Our Cyber Wellness Curriculum is based on the MOE’s Cyber Wellness (CW) Framework and customized to meet the needs of our pupils. </p>
