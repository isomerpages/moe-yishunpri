### Vision

To nurture Future Ready and Responsible Digital Learners.

##### **Mission**

*   <p style="text-align: justify;">The ICT Department in Yishun Primary School aims to prepare our pupils for the future, equipping them with the 21st Century Competencies and guide them to be discerning and responsible digital learners, who are rooted in values. </p>

##### **Beliefs**

1.      Pupils’ learning are empowered by technology.

2.      Pupils are responsible and savvy technology users. 


### ICT in Total Curriculum 

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that ICT is a tool to amplify the learning of our pupils – deepening subject knowledge and acquiring 21st Century Competencies. In Yishun Primary School, we integrate technology into the school’s Total Curriculum based on sound pedagogy approaches. Aligning with MOE Baseline ICT Standard, pupils will be exposed to different technologies tools and computer skills (e.g. Productivity Tools, Collaborative Tools, Communication Tools, curating skills and Basic computer operation), which aims to help them to deepen or extend their understanding for the subject. We want to ensure that every pupil’s learning experience is empowered, enhanced and enriched by technology. </p>

  

### **Cyber Wellness - Navigating the Cyber World**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping pupils to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, they should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe responsible use. Pupils should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this technology-driven world, the cyber world has become part of our daily lives. Hence, it is important to educate our pupils in the navigation of the cyber world. Our Cyber Wellness Curriculum is based on the MOE’s Cyber Wellness (CW) Framework and customized to meet the needs of our pupils. </p>

### MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework

<p style="text-align: justify;">MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and 'Positive Peer Influcence' when adhered to will anchor your child’s well-being in cyberspace as they will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. </p>  

### Cyber Wellness Lesson

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cyber Wellness lessons aim to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).  The main platforms for the delivery of the lessons are via Form Teacher Guidance Period (in Primary schools) and assembly talks (in Primary schools), and in the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum (in Secondary Schools and Pre-University). </p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Key Cyber Wellness topics are also incorporated into the formal curriculum through subjects such as English and Mother Tongue Languages where appropriate. The MOE Sexuality Education, The Growing Years package also has Cyber Wellness-related contexts where relevant.  </p>

### Cyber Wellness Programmes

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond the Cyber Wellness Lessons, ICT Department also designs programmes and events such as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors programme, Cyber Wellness Week, Recess Activities and workshop for identified pupils. All these programmes and events are aligned with our school’s values and are customised to meet the needs of our pupils.</p>
