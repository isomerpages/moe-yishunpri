##### **Vision**
Resilient Learners, Confident Problem Solvers

##### **Mission**
Providing an authentic and engaging learning environment to develop reflective and critical Mathematical thinkers.

##### **Key Mathematics Programmes**
##### **Math Carnival**
Primary 1 and Primary 2 students have an exciting and authentic learning experience through the Math Carnival. They are engaged in the learning of Mathematics through a myriad of hands-on activities and real-life problem-solving scenarios.

Complementing the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, the activities have enabled students to develop an appreciation for Mathematics beyond the classroom and textbooks and have joy for the learning of Mathematics. They apply various thinking skills and heuristics to solve non-routine Mathematics problems. They also use concrete objects and pictorial representations to illustrate Mathematical concepts.

##### **Math & Science Trail** 
In the effort of making the learning of Mathematics more engaging and exciting, an ICT-infused Math & Science Trail is conducted for all Primary 3 students. During this interdisciplinary trail, students are given the opportunity to apply Mathematics concepts to solve problems outside the classroom. Hence, this learning experience gives them an opportunity to relate knowledge to reality. The trail also helps to build the students' social skills and promote team-building.

##### **E2K (Mathematics)**
The E2K (Mathematics) is an enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

Students are also given opportunities to collaborate with their peers through activities such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess and to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
