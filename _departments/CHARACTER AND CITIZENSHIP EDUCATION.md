# CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

## Our Belief and Guiding Principles

Our school believes that our children can develop their character and grow into confident individuals who are grounded on sound moral values. We aim to inculcate our school values in our students to help them develop a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong which will guide our students’ behaviour in the private and public spheres. In addition to our school values, we also have the concept of Growth Mindset anchoring our curriculum frame. To live up to the school values, to develop social emotional competencies and all other fundamentals of a person’s character, our students would need to develop a growth mindset and believe in their ability to learn and grow.
