##### **Our Belief and Guiding Principles**
Our school believes that our children can develop their character and grow into confident individuals who are grounded on sound moral values. We aim to inculcate our school values in our students to help them develop a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong which will guide our students’ behaviour in the private and public spheres. In addition to our school values, we also have the concept of Growth Mindset anchoring our curriculum frame. To live up to the school values, to develop social emotional competencies and all other fundamentals of a person’s character, our students would need to develop a growth mindset and believe in their ability to learn and grow.

##### **CCE Lessons**
CCE Lessons in Primary Schools are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). At Lower Primary, CCE Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). 30 minutes is allocated per week to allow teachers to equip students with social and emotional competencies. During FTGP, play activities are facilitated by the form and co-form teachers to build a safe classroom environment for students and to enhance the bonding between teachers and students. There will also be teaching of social and emotional learning (SEL) skills, cyber wellness education and enhanced career guidance for the upper primary students.

##### **Sexuality Education**
Sexuality Education (SEd) is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.

##### **National Education (NE) Commemorative Events**

##### **Character Education**
The school’s core values are the guiding principles towards the planning of the departmental programmes. It is committed to ensure that students experience diverse programmes which will develop them holistically, anchoring on values and positive characters.

##### **Celebration of Character**
Celebration of Character (COC) aims to inculcate strong values and build character in our students. The programme specially designed and catered for our students is carried out in an engaging and meaningful manner to bring across different core values of Gratitude, Care, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility and Integrity.

##### **Values in Action (VIA)**
Through the acquisition and application of values, knowledge, and skills, Values in Action (VIA) is a Key Student Development Experience (SDE) that aspires to build socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. VIA in our school is designed to encourage student initiative and ownership to the school and community. Students reflect on their experiences, the principles they have implemented, and how they might continue to contribute meaningfully as part of VIA. Through our partnership with different organisations, our students participated actively in contributing to the community.

##### **Self-directed Learning**

##### **LaunchPad@YPS**
LaunchPad@YPS is a platform where internal and external programmes are advertised to students. Our students are given the liberty to register for the programmes they would like to take part in based on their passion or strengths. Given the opportunity to take charge of their learning, our students will be able to determine the knowledge, skills and experience they would like to gain and in the process, develop greater self-awareness, self-confidence and self-reflection. At the same time, they will learn to make responsible decisions which will help them to develop a greater understanding of themselves, their actions and their choices. Empowering our students with the freedom to make their own decisions responsibly and manage their own learning would help our students grow into sensible adults ready to take on the challenges in the 21st century.

In addition to promoting self-directed learning and responsible decision making, we hope we would be able to inspire passion in learning and also provide an opportunity for our students to gain and deepen their knowledge, skills and experiences.
