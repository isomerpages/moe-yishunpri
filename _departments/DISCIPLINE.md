# DISCIPLINE

## **Our Discipline Philosophy**

### Discipline with Care

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yishun Primary School is committed to establish a caring and enabling learning environment for all students. The school adopts a proactive and educative approach to develop self-discipline and good character in our students.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school envisions every student to be a peer supporter, where students form a strong network of support in their classes, CCAs or other peer groups. Through the CCE 2021 Curriculum, students are equipped to appreciate diversity, show empathy and care for one another and seek guidance from a trusted adult when necessary. They acquire the relevant knowledge and skills through explicit teaching during CCE lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) and other school-based initiatives.</p>

Leading Peers to Leading Leaders

The school anchors on the 5 practices of exemplary leadership by Kouzes & Postner. It has many platforms for leadership development beyond the classrooms. Besides the Peer Support Leaders, Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors, CCA leaders and Bus Safety Leaders, the school has a prefectorial board which comprises of more than 170 prefects from primary three to primary six. The Prefects strive to lead by example and be positive role models for their peers. They undergo scenario-based training to ensure the safety and discipline of the students. The Prefects also serve and lead the student body in various school activities and events. They lead in pledge taking and perform duties to ensure the well-being of their peers.

Leaders who demonstrated more leadership qualities are further developed to the next tier of leadership - Leading Leaders. Several senior prefects in the Leading Leaders served as the Executive Committee (EXCO) members in the prefectorial board. This team gathers suggestions from the student population, via the students suggestion platform, to initiate projects or plan activities for their peers.
