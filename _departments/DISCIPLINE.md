# DISCIPLINE

## **Our Discipline Philosophy**

### Discipline with Care

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yishun Primary School is committed to establish a caring and enabling learning environment for all students. The school adopts a proactive and educative approach to develop self-discipline and good character in our students.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school envisions every student to be a peer supporter, where students form a strong network of support in their classes, CCAs or other peer groups. Through the CCE 2021 Curriculum, students are equipped to appreciate diversity, show empathy and care for one another and seek guidance from a trusted adult when necessary. They acquire the relevant knowledge and skills through explicit teaching during CCE lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) and other school-based initiatives.</p>
