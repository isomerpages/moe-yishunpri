# TAMIL LANGUAGE

### Mission 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tamil Language Unit strives to encourage the use of spoken Tamil amongst our pupils, ensure that they take pride in their identity and acquire core values and skills that are necessary in developing them into Global citizens.  </p>

### Highlights of Some Key Programmes:


### Mother Tongue Fortnight (P1-P6)

<p style="text-align: justify;">In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, the YPS Tamil language unit held a wide range of activities for the Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels as part of Mother Tongue Fortnight. These activities are designed to ignite student’s interests in Mother Tongue Languages through exposure to performing arts, handicrafts and games.</p>
