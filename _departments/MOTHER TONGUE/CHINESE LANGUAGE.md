In the STAR programme, our MTL teachers provide support to build good reading culture in the school. They have designed a “Solar Rewarding System” to record every pupil’s reading progress and give affirmation to the active readers during Celebrate Success session at the school level.

Our MTL teachers have also designed a reading package for different levels which emphasizes on our school /CCE values. Every level starts with a guided reading session and follow by the class activities of the same theme for every level.

##### **Cultural Performance Exposure Programme**  
Chinese Language Unit has been participating in the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES),    (文化随意门) - an initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL). It aims to expose our pupils to Chinese language-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing arts groups, through providing schools with the necessary funding and support.
