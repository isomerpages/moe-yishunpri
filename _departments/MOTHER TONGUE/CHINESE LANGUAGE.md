<p style="text-align: justify;">In the STAR programme, our MTL teachers provide support to build good reading culture in the school. They have designed a “Solar Rewarding System” to record every pupil’s reading progress and give affirmation to the active readers during Celebrate Success session at the school level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our MTL teachers have also designed a reading package for different levels which emphasizes on our school /CCE values. Every level starts with a guided reading session and follow by the class activities of the same theme for every level.</p>

|        |   Name of Storybooks  |     School /CCE Values    |
|:---------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
