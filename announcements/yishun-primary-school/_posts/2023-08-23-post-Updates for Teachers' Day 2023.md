Dear Alumni,

Due to the upcoming Presidential Elections for which our school will serve as a polling centre, we regretfully inform you that we are unable to host ex-students during the upcoming Teachers' Day Celebrations. However, we invite you to share your well-wishes on our dedicated page created for this occasion. Your understanding and participation are greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
