# PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

Dear Pupils, Parents and Partners,  

Welcome to Yishun Primary School (YPS)!

In YPS, we value every pupil and are committed to develop them holistically.  We believe that with the right support, every child has the potential to grow into confident, gracious citizens, who embraces lifelong learning.  In this regard, three statements from our school song resonate strongly with me:

<u><i>In work or in play, we will strive every day (Commitment in Endeavours)</i></u>

Learning is never easy. But we can pick up good habits and skills to help ourselves. We can do this by putting in our best effort in every task or assignment handed to us. Like the saying goes “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”. We need to be brave to take the first step to learn new things in order to remain relevant in this fast-changing world.

The ability to learn confidently and continuously through life is one of the best gifts that we can offer to the younger generation. In this regard, we endeavour to imbue in our pupils the values, knowledge, and skills so that they can discover their passion and interest, and embrace learning in studies and play. This would in turn lead to lifelong learning for balanced and fulfilling lives.

<u><i>Ready to serve whenever is the call (Service to Others)</i></u>

The drive towards self-improvement is important. But at the same time, we should also be mindful of the less privileged and be ready to serve and contribute in the community.

Regardless of our achievements, it is without a doubt that many people would have contributed to our ‘success’. It could be a timely advice from a teacher, a reminder by a classmate, and even a kind gesture from a stall holder in the canteen who served us a nourishing meal. No man is an island and we need to show gratitude and remind ourselves that we too have a part to play.

<u><i>Do our best and be the best (Striving for Excellence)</i></u>

Indeed, we can all make a difference and our collective efforts can culminate in bringing positive change to the larger environment.  We celebrate the efforts of our pupils and will continue to provide learning opportunities in both academic and non-academic domains.

We believe in the innate potential of all our charges, and would provide the necessary support for them to grow and strive to be better versions of themselves.

Moving forward, the school will continue to focus on pupils’ holistic development, and I take this opportunity to thank all parents and partners for your continued support. Together, I am confident that Yishun Primary School will continue to grow and develop world-ready youths for tomorrow!
