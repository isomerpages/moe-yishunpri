Yishun Primary School strongly believes that habits can be cultivated and better shaped in Primary Schools.  
  
The Healthy Set Meal Programme in our school canteen aims to nurture and reinforce healthy dietary habits to the students. These Healthy Set Meals, served in compartmentalised trays similar to a bento box, incorporate the appropriate proportions of food from four main food groups â€“ rice, meat, fruit and vegetables.  
  
With the introduction of the Healthy Set Meals, students will be able to consume a well-balanced meal with the required nutrition intake.
