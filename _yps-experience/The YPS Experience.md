We believe every child in Yishun Primary can learn and grow through a holistic education in a caring and nurturing environment. Our holistic education, covering both academic and non-academic areas, aims to develop a passion and curiosity for learning in our students who can become self-directed lifelong learners. We are committed to nurturing our students to be leaders of characters who are guided by our school values of Gratitude, Care, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility and Integrity. With a sound moral compass, we believe our students can be effective leaders of positive influence who contribute to the betterment of others and environment. To inspire our students to lead a fulfilling life, we develop our students’ appreciation for the Arts and encourage them to embrace a healthy and balanced lifestyle through physical activities.

To deliver our holistic learning experience, we have a broad range of platforms and opportunities for students to build their confidence, develop skills and competencies to prepare them for the challenges of tomorrow. Given a range of opportunities, students can discover their own passions and interests, allowing them to pursue their aspirations.

To prepare our students for life-long learning, we place great emphasis on empowering our students with the Growth Mindset. Our Growth Mindset curriculum is framed by the following 3 key messages:

1.  I can learn and improve through hard work.
2.   I become better by learning from mistake and challenges.
3.   I think positively and will always do my best.

The Growth Mindset is instilled in our students through holistic learning experiences in school. We encourage our students to view challenges as opportunities for growth, embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process and to persevere even when faced with setbacks. We believe with the Growth Mindset, all students can learn and grow regardless of their starting points.

Yishun Primary’s commitment to fostering a caring and nurturing community, and well-rounded education will lead every student to feel valued and supported, allowing them to realise their fullest potential.
