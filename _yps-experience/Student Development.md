### **Our Belief and Guiding Principles**

*<center><img src="/images/Experience/Student%20Development/sdt_01_v1.jpg">Yishun Primary School Character Education Framework</center>*

At Yishun Primary School, we aim to nurture in our students the GRIT (Gratitude, Care, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity) core values that are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. We hope to guide our students to develop a growth mindset and believe in their ability to learn and grow, discern between right and wrong, and help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.

#### **Key Programmes**

**<u>Structured CCE Lessons</u>**
<br>
CCE Lessons in Primary Schools are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). During FTGP, Form Teachers facilitate lessons to foster a safe and supportive classroom environment and strengthen teacher-student relationships. At Lower Primary, CCE Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). Upper primary students also receive instruction in social and emotional learning (SEL), Cyberwellness education and Education Career &amp; Guidance (ECG).

**<u>Character Education</u>**
<br>
The schoolâ€™s core values serves as guiding principles in the planning of  departmental programmes such as Celebration of Character (CoC) and Values in Action (VIA).  The school is dedicated to providing its students with a wide range of programmes that develop them holistically, with a strong emphasis on values and positive character.
