### **Our Belief and Guiding Principles**

*<center><img src="/images/Experience/Student%20Development/sdt_01_v1.jpg">Yishun Primary School Character Education Framework</center>*

At Yishun Primary School, we aim to nurture in our students the GRIT (Gratitude, Care, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity) core values that are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. We hope to guide our students to develop a growth mindset and believe in their ability to learn and grow, discern between right and wrong, and help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.

#### **Key Programmes**

**<u>Structured CCE Lessons</u>**
<br>
CCE Lessons in Primary Schools are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). During FTGP, Form Teachers facilitate lessons to foster a safe and supportive classroom environment and strengthen teacher-student relationships. At Lower Primary, CCE Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). Upper primary students also receive instruction in social and emotional learning (SEL), Cyberwellness education and Education Career &amp; Guidance (ECG).

**<u>Character Education</u>**
<br>
The school’s core values serves as guiding principles in the planning of  departmental programmes such as Celebration of Character (CoC) and Values in Action (VIA).  The school is dedicated to providing its students with a wide range of programmes that develop them holistically, with a strong emphasis on values and positive character.

The Celebration of Character (CoC) programme is designed to inculcate strong values and build character in our students. It is delivered in engaging and meaningful ways to convey the GRIT core values.

Values in Action (VIA) is a key Student Development Experience (SDE) that aims to foster socially responsible citizens who make meaningful contributions to their community. It encourages student to take initiative and ownership in their school and community through the acquisition and application of values, knowledge, and skills. Students reflect on their experiences, the principles they have implemented, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

Our school partners with various organisations to provide opportunities for students to participate in meaningful community work and gain exposure to different cultures and perspectives. These experiences help student build a sense of social awareness and appreciation of diversity from a young age, preparing them to become active citizens and contributors to society.

**<u>Student Leadership</u>**

Yishun Primary School believes that every student has leadership potential, and has implemented a three-level leadership programme to develop their leadership competencies.

**Level 1 – Leading Self (All Students)**
<br>
The first level, Leading Self, is designed for all students and focuses on teaching them the essential Practices of Exemplary Leadership. All students undergo explicit teaching of the leadership practices over their 6 years to learn to manage themselves in a responsible way before they can lead and help others.

**Level 2 – Leading Peers (Leadership Appointments in the Class Committee)**
<br>
At Yishun Primary, every student gets the opportunity to be a leader and will get to serve in the Class Committee. Students undergo role-specific training via SLS. Leadership appointments are rotated every semester for Primary 2 to 5 students to provide students with a range of leadership experiences.

**Level 3 – Leading Leaders (Student Leaders)**
<br>
The third level, Leading Leaders, is aimed at enhancing leadership competencies in students who demonstrate exceptional leadership qualities. These students are nominated by their teachers to take on the role of prefects and CCA leaders.

Student leaders go through additional training on Practices of Exemplary Leadership. They are given scenario-based questions to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in real-world situations. With the knowledge and skills taught, they learn to apply them during group work, CCA sessions and school events.

Student leaders are als offered various opportunities to showcase and develop their leadership skills by assisting in school events and activities.

**Student Leaders’ Investiture**
<br>
The Student Leaders’ Investiture is held annually to recognise and affirm the efforts of our student leaders, and to formally introduce them to the school community. During the investiture, student leaders recite the Student Leaders’ Pledge as a promise to uphold the school values and commit to serving the school.

**Prefectorial Executive Committee (EXCO)**
<br>
The Prefectorial EXCO consists of senior student leaders who have been identified to lead in organising and executing events.

As an EXCO, the team gathers suggestions from the student population via the student’s suggestion platform, Our Yishun Voices, which acts as a voice of the student body. Through this platform, students are encouraged to play a more active role in serving the school community by initiating projects or planning activities for their peers.
