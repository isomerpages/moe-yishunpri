### **Our Belief and Guiding Principles**

*<center><img src="/images/Experience/Student%20Development/sdt_01_v1.jpg">Yishun Primary School Character Education Framework</center>*

At Yishun Primary School, we aim to nurture in our students the GRIT (Gratitude, Care, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity) core values that are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. We hope to guide our students to develop a growth mindset and believe in their ability to learn and grow, discern between right and wrong, and help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.
