CCAs are critical in providing our students with a holistic education. Our CCAs strive to bring out the best in each student in order to develop them into caring, confident learners and leaders of character.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lvTrj-R2M0lKaTjDR_soLNTT9vGqnxP9B45vZnHr5HJ0C_kKc1f8f6uoCwUaEVi3UtD8H6x2ZLUq-q9iGkrUECPQFW-OLiX6lz-neyyuWXiA2GKiR_iQPqSFJFz4BY76kbgHiupxn8o0U5FgM4XFwmA)

CCAs are learning experiences beyond the classroom that are essential to our students' overall development. 

They provide diverse and authentic opportunities for our students to learn, apply, and demonstrate values, good character, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SUsjVbSIHVd4TXApt1F4rh88t-7qLb4dlraHygJAahyu4a5ADQVOey-0PX4wWtJJg1BPmQ5GCItj2Rs4k2SsEll865wx6e2sph1Tmvvd1Hw96IGfHFFjZwys1u0V09n31b4ZrmOWxYOiQocISij4kCE)

Whether students are volunteering in the community, supporting a school event, competing in sports, or performing on stage, these authentic experiences provide rich opportunities for our students to reinforce, internalize, and deepen their learning.

CCA focuses on the development of specific knowledge, skills, and values based on the CCA chosen by the student. CCA allows our students to discover their interests and talents while also providing a platform for them from various backgrounds to form friendships and socialize.

Every student from Primary 3 to Primary 6 is strongly encouraged to participate in a CCA and benefit from it. 

The school organises a CCA Open House, where students will have the opportunity to explore the various types of CCAs and select the CCA which interests them and which they may have an aptitude for. To promore responsible decision-making, the ‘Choose the Right CCA’ Booklet has been crafted by the school to teach students to identify their interest and make an informed choice among the many CCAs they would like to join. Parents further support this process by discussing the CCA choices with the student and guide them to choose a CCA that they will enjoy and stay committed to.
