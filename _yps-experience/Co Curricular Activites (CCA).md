<p>CCAs are critical in providing our students with a holistic education.
Our CCAs strive to bring out the best in each student in order to develop
them into caring, confident learners and leaders of character.</p>

<p>CCAs are learning experiences beyond the classroom that are essential
to our students' overall development.</p>
<p>They provide diverse and authentic opportunities for our students to learn,
apply, and demonstrate values, good character, social-emotional competencies,
and citizenship dispositions.</p>

<p>Whether students are volunteering in the community, supporting a school
event, competing in sports, or performing on stage, these authentic experiences
provide rich opportunities for our students to reinforce, internalize,
and deepen their learning.</p>
<p>CCA focuses on the development of specific knowledge, skills, and values
based on the CCA chosen by the student. CCA allows our students to discover
their interests and talents while also providing a platform for them from
various backgrounds to form friendships and socialize.</p>
<p>Every student from Primary 3 to Primary 6 is strongly encouraged to participate
in a CCA and benefit from it.</p>
<p>The school organises CCA Experience sessions, where Primary 3 students
will have the opportunity to experience up to 3 of their preferred CCAs
over a few weeks. After this experience, students will select the CCA which
interests them and which they may have an aptitude for. To promote responsible
decision-making, the ‘Choose the Right CCA’ Booklet has been crafted by
the school to teach students to identify their interest and make an informed
choice among the many CCAs they would like to join. Parents further support
this process by discussing the CCA choices with the student and guide them
to choose a CCA that they will enjoy and stay committed to.</p>
