<p><strong><u>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) at Yishun Primary School</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Yishun Primary School, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play a vital
role in providing our students with a holistic education. Beyond the classroom,
CCAs offer diverse and authentic opportunities for students to develop
into caring, confident learners and leaders of character. Through these
experiences, students cultivate values, good character, social-emotional
competencies, and citizenship dispositions, reinforcing their overall development.</p>
<p>CCAs enable students to discover their interests and talents while fostering
friendships and social interactions among peers from diverse backgrounds.
Whether volunteering in the community, supporting school events, competing
in sports, or performing on stage, students engage in meaningful activities
that deepen their learning and build essential life skills.</p>
<p>Every student from Primary 3 to Primary 6 is strongly encouraged to participate
in a CCA and benefit from it. To facilitate informed choices, our school
organises CCA Experience sessions for Primary 3 students. During these
sessions, students explore up to three CCAs of their preference over four
sessions before selecting the one that aligns with their interests and
aptitudes. Parents are encouraged to guide their children in choosing a
CCA they will enjoy and remain committed to.</p>
<p>Categories of CCAs The CCAs offered at Yishun Primary School fall into
the following categories:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Physical Sports (PS): Develop robustness, fair play, and team spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual and Performing Arts (VPA): Instil a sense of graciousness and appreciation
for the rich culture and heritage of our multi-racial society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniformed Groups (UG): Foster self-reliance, resilience, discipline, and
a spirit of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clubs and Societies (CS): Provide avenues for students to explore and
extend their interests in specialized areas, honing their knowledge, communication,
and technical skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values,
and attitudes through sustained participation in their chosen CCA. These
activities also serve as excellent platforms to cultivate core values,
social and emotional competencies, and 21st Century Competencies, preparing
students for the future.</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes Through CCA participation, students will develop:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Passion for their chosen CCA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge, skills, and values related to their activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership and teamwork abilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendship and belonging within their school community</p>

<li>
<p>Core values, social-emotional competencies, and 21st Century Competencies</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>At Yishun Primary School, we believe that a well-organized and implemented
CCA programme can spark a lifelong love for a particular pursuit—be it
in sports, the arts, or service to others—helping individuals lead a balanced
and fulfilling life beyond their school years.</p>
