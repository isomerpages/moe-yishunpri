Our curriculum aims to develop students holistically. The school recognises that each student is unique, with different interests and talents, strengths and experiences. At Yishun Primary, we provide a student-centred curriculum that is designed to inspire a love for learning in all students, engaging them to take ownership of their learning, while developing their 21st century competencies and skills.

Each subject in our curriculum adopts a range of distinct teaching approaches to support our students in developing specific knowledge, skills and values within the subject discipline. Learning experiences are supported by educational technology platforms and tools such as the MOE Student Learning Space and Student iCON (Google Workspace).

Yishun Primary is committed to providing a caring and nurturing environment for our students to learn and grow. With a strong foundation of learning anchored in sound values, our students will be ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.

### **English**
To develop students into empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers, the EL department provides effective language learning through a student-centered curriculum that starts in Primary 1. To achieve this goal, the department incorporates STELLAR 2.0 pedagogical strategies, including the Shared Book Approach, Modified Language Experience Approach, and Reading for Pleasure. By utilising these strategies, the department creates differentiated instructions that meet the specific learning needs of each student, inspiring and motivating them to take ownership of their learning and develop a lifelong love for English.

Moreover, the EL department offers programmes that cater to different skill levels. The Build Programmes provide customised lesson packages to build on studentsâ€™ language skills taught in the classroom, while the EL Bloom Programmes offer opportunities for students who display a talent for the language to explore journalism and creative writing. For students who require more support in language acquisition, the EL Bridge Programmes provide extensive support.

In addition to developing language skills, the department also focuses on promoting effective language use and a love for reading among students. The annual English Language Festival engages students in activities that enhance their knowledge of language features, receptive skills, and productive skills. Furthermore, the infusion of school values and a Growth Mindset in the EL curriculum, along with the Project Work, aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the 21st century and beyond.
