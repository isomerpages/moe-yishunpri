Our curriculum aims to develop students holistically. The school recognises that each student is unique, with different interests and talents, strengths and experiences. At Yishun Primary, we provide a student-centred curriculum that is designed to inspire a love for learning in all students, engaging them to take ownership of their learning, while developing their 21st century competencies and skills.

Each subject in our curriculum adopts a range of distinct teaching approaches to support our students in developing specific knowledge, skills and values within the subject discipline. Learning experiences are supported by educational technology platforms and tools such as the MOE Student Learning Space and Student iCON (Google Workspace).

Yishun Primary is committed to providing a caring and nurturing environment for our students to learn and grow. Our students are provided time and space to reflect on and reinforce their learning (<a href="https://for.edu.sg/yps-homework-policy" target="_blank">YPS Homework Policy</a>). With a strong foundation of learning anchored in sound values, our students will be ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.
