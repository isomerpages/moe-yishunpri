Our curriculum aims to develop students holistically. The school recognises that each student is unique, with their own set of strengths and experiences. Therefore, the school provides a range of learning opportunities to meet the needs of all students. Our student-centred curriculum is designed to inspire a love for learning in all students, engage students to take ownership of their learning, and develop 21st century competencies and skills in them.

Each of our subjects in the curriculum has a distinct teaching approach to support our students in developing specific knowledge, skills and values within the subject discipline supported by educational technology platforms (such as Singapore Learning Space, Google Workspace) and tools.

Yishun Primary is committed to providing a caring and nurturing environment for our students to learn and grow. With a strong foundation of learning anchored in sound values, our students will be ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.
