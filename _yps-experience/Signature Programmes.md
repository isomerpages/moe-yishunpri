Learning for life is a skill, value and an attitude we hope to develop in every student in Yishun Primary. We encourage our students to learn actively and independently by providing opportunities for them to learn beyond the classroom. 

We have uniquely crafted our Applied Learning Programme, Learning for Life Programme and LaunchPad@YPS to support students in developing knowledge, skills and values that stay with them through life. We strive to nurture the love of learning in our students and support them in their pursuit of passions and interests.
