##### **8th National Primary School "Picture Book Creation" Competition**
This competition aims to provide students with the opportunity to work collaboratively and develop their Chinese Creative Writing Skills to write an original story and illustrate the story.

These books tell the stories of characters who demonstrated resilience and growth mindset in the face of challenges. 
Like the characters in the books, our students have faced challenges during the creation of these books and did not waver. 

They demonstrated resilience and growth mindset as they worked together to brainstorm ideas and also picked up new skills while working on the book.
