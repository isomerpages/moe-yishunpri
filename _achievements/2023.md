These books tell the stories of characters who demonstrated resilience and growth mindset in the face of challenges. 
Like the characters in the books, our students have faced challenges during the creation of these books and did not waver. 

They demonstrated resilience and growth mindset as they worked together to brainstorm ideas and also picked up new skills while working on the book.

Congratulations to the following pupils who received the awards!
