Junior Civil Defence Lionhearter Challenge 2022 
------------------------------------------------

In alignment with the Learn for Life initiative to ignite the joy of learning, Qifa Primary School organised a Memory Games Challenge for Primary 5 & 6 students who are taking Foundation Chinese Language on 10 March 2021.    
The rationale of the challenge is to provide a platform for students taking Foundation Chinese Language to pick up some useful memory techniques through fun and engaging games station activities.  Congratulations to the following pupils who received the Merit awards!
