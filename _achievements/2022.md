Junior Civil Defence Lionhearter Challenge 2022 
------------------------------------------------

In March this year, the Singapore Civil Defence Force organised the Junior Civil Defence Lionhearter Challenger 2022. The challenge comprised a series of exciting activities, culminating in a virtual event which saw students pit their emergency preparedness knowledge and quick wits against other teams. 

The challenge aimed to equip students with emergency preparedness skills including life-saving skills, which can be applied during an emergency. Under the guidance of Mdm Fauziah, five students formed a team and took part in the challenge.

Congratulations to the following pupils who received the awards!

Teacher Mentor: Mdm Fauziah Alang
