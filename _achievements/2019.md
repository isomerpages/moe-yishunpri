Mother Tongue Languages Symposium 2019
--------------------------------------

Our pupil, Nur Ariana Bte Abdul Aziz of 4 Nation Loving, was invited to perform a Malay song and dance item titled ‘Tari Tualang Tiga’ at the Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) held at Suntec Singapore International Convention & Exhibition Centre on 24 August 2019.  

The theme of MTLS 2019 is “A Garden for Joyful Discovery” which focuses on how children learn, grow and thrive in a vibrant and immersive MTL environment and develop a keen sense of life-long learning for our Mother Tongue Languages.
