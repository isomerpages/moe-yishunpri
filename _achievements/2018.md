National Stamp Collecting Competition 
--------------------------------------

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yishun Primary School participated in the National Stamp Collecting Competition 2018 organised by Singapore Philatelic Museum. The annual competition seeks to promote the study of postage stamps and philatelic materials to learn about the world. Participants selected and researched on a topic of their choice, and presented their findings through the English Language and a variety of philatelic materials. The competition enabled participants to sharpen their research and organisation skills as well as their language and writing skills. Kudos to these pupils and the teachers who had prepared them for this competition.</p>

 We attained 3 Silver Awards and 1 Bronze Award.
