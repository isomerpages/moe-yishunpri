<p style="text-align: justify;">FamilyMatters@School (formerly known as SFE) equips parents and young adults with skills to nurture positive family relationships. At Yishun Primary School, we work closely with MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development) in organising family life programmes that help our parents better connect with their children.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A family is the anchor in our lives, bringing us love, joy and happiness. A happy family does not just happen. It takes effort and commitment. Through our partnership with MSF, we believe we can help to create a pro-family environment through:  </p>  

*   Instilling positive values and shaping mindset towards family, marriage and parenthood
*   Educating and empowering individuals through their life journey to form and build strong families
